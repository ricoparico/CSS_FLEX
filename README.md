| Navigation Bar | Product and Content Containers     | Responsive Design |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Flexbox Layout: The .navbar uses display: flex to lay out its child elements (links) in a row. It has a defined height and background color for visual separation.    | Flex Wrapping: Containers like .product-container use flex-wrap: wrap to ensure items can flow to the next line when there's insufficient space.|Flex Properties: You've applied flex: 1 1 calc(...) to cards, controlling how many appear in a row based on the screen size. For instance, the .product-card is set to fit 4 items per row, while .employee-card fits 3.|  | 
| List Styling: The .nav-list is also a flex container, allowing horizontal arrangement of navigation items with spacing between them.       | Card Styles: Each card (e.g., .product-card, .employee-card) is designed with padding, margins, and a light background for clarity, making them visually appealing. |Image Resizing: The images in the gallery are also made responsive with a width calculated to fit three images in a row.|
